# CAR ACCIDENT SEVERITY
This repository contains files produced for my IBM Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone Project

# Datasource
Detailed dataset of road accidents and involved vehicles in the UK (2005-2016)

https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles#Accident_Information.csv

# Use case
Predict accident severity at each output area (LSOA) given date, time and driving conditions. For each Police Force we build a prediction model with the following objective:

<i> every line in the file represents a unique traffic accident (identified by the AccidentIndex column), featuring various properties related to the accident as columns. Date range: 2005-2017 </i>
